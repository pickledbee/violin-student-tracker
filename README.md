A schedule and payment tracker for violin students
Violin Student Tracker

This project is a tool designed to help organize and manage lesson schedules and payment tracking for violin students. With this tracker, I aim to simplify the process of keeping accurate records of each student's lessons, payments, and progress notes, allowing for more time to focus on teaching rather than administrative tasks.

Purpose

The Violin Student Tracker serves as an organized, centralized location for handling all aspects of student management, including lesson scheduling, payment records, and any additional notes regarding a student's progress. This tool is designed to improve my workflow as a violin teacher, ensuring I stay on top of each student's lessons and finances without manual bookkeeping.

Features

Lesson Scheduling: A record of each student's lesson schedule, including dates and times, to ensure consistency and avoid scheduling conflicts.

Payment Tracking: Easily track payments made by students, outstanding balances, due dates, and payment history.

Student Notes: A section for documenting each student's progress, techniques worked on, and any specific goals or notes from each lesson.

Automated Reminders (Future Feature): A planned feature to automatically remind students of upcoming lessons and outstanding payments (if integrating with email/SMS).


Planned Usage

1. Set Up: I will populate the tracker with initial data for each student, including name, contact details, scheduled lesson times, and payment information.


2. Regular Updates: After each lesson, I’ll update the student's lesson record, payment status, and add any relevant notes on their progress.


3. Monthly Review: At the end of each month, I’ll review the tracker to ensure all payments are up-to-date and address any pending payments with students.



This tracker will be continuously improved based on any emerging needs, with features added over time to support effective student management.
